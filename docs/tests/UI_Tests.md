# UI Tests

All the UI Tests are located under the folder [/test](../../test/) in the root directory of the repository.

These files are served in the development environment via Webpack. You can access them by following the instructions of the main [README](../../README.md#running-instructions-with-container). Once Webpack is serving the DDV library, those test files will be accesible at http://localhost:8080/test/.

| Description | Validate successful visualization rendering from a valid JSON URL. |
| Expected Result | Mammal must be the concept with darkest color, and must be directly connected with Horse, Whale, Bear, Zebra, Dolphin and Monkey, each one located in one of the six sides of the hexagon. These are located next to Mammal because they are the most relevant skills related to Mammal. There must be a black line that separates Horse with Whale, human and monkey. This occurs because in the graph, those terms are not directly connected (there is not an edge that connects those terms with Horse). Although Wolf and Dog are related with Mammal, they are out of the main group because they are only connected with the term Mammal, but the six spaces around it have already been filled by other concepts with greater values. There are three orange concepts (Human, Zebra, Dog) and 1 blue concept (Bambu), the other hexagons must belong to the green category. |
